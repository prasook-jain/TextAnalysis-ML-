$13 is a considerable amount of money to be spent so I think, It would be nice to see cheaper movie then waiting in line to eat some special candy.
Candies can be eat most of the time, at our home-town. But we are in tour now so let go to 21 street of these amazing city and watch the movie, I have heard that there is a very cheaper theater.
