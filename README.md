#Text Analysis and Machine Learning

These is a Simple Study purpose project of Text Analysis and ML. It has a simple task initially to **generate Graphical representation of related entity words given in the given unstructured text**. In the process I first learn how individual word get extracted and removal of suffix is important in finding the meaning form stemmed root word. But Than I find a algorithm which is word2vec, and I find it very useful to learn. So I tend to learn it first.

*The Basic Concept I had learned are

__Task 1 --__
>Word extraction
>Stemming
>Word to Vector (Initial Part)

*Next Task are

>Create a CBOW and Skip-gram Algorithm
>Implement Word to Vector using SVD in CBOW and Skip-gram algorithm

*Future Vision :-

> As the main notion of these study generate a graphical representation from unstructured text between real word Entity.
> For graphical view use D3.js with JSON conversion of my C++ API
> Create a site, a portal, which upload a text file from user and generate Graphical representation on the website.
