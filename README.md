#Text Analysis and Machine Learning

These is a Simple Study purpose project of Text Analysis and ML. It has a simple task initially to **generate Graphical representation of related entity words given in the given unstructured text**. In the process I first learn how individual word get extracted and removal of suffix is important in finding the meaning form stemmed root word. But Than I find a algorithm which is word2vec, and I find it very useful to learn. So I tend to learn it first.


*The Concept I learn till now:*

__Task 1 --__
* Word extraction
* Stemming
* Word to Vector (Initial Part)



__Task 2 --__
* Implement the SVD algorithm  
* Add the important part of the project. The Single Value Decomposition of the word co-occurrence matrix.
* think their might be pseudo relations because of not removing stopwords, I considered stopwords which are in NLTK kit.

*Next Task are*

* Create a CBOW and Skip-gram Algorithm
* Implement Word to Vector using SVD in CBOW and Skip-gram algorithm

* Future Vision :-*

* As the main notion of these study generate a graphical representation from unstructured text between real word Entity.
* For graphical view use D3.js with JSON conversion of my C++ API
* Create a site, a portal, which upload a text file from user and generate Graphical representation on the website.
